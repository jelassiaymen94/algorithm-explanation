# 1- Bubble Sorting

Bubble sort algorithm compare consecutive items, if they're out of place, it will swap them, the highest number will be on the right with each iteration, it's time complexity is high so it's not suitable for large data.

## Bubble sorting pseudocode

```
for i from 1 to N
  for j form 1 to N - 1
    if a[j] > a[j+1]
    swap (a[j], a[j+1])
```
